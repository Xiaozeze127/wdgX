# wdgX

Static website directory generation

I am using JavaScript to rewrite and make it a cli tool. For previous versions of python, please check the [Releases](https://github.com/Xiaozeze127/wdgX/releases)

# Install

```shell
npm install @xiaozeze127/wdgx@0.0.1 -g
```

then you can use in shell

```shell
wdgX
```

you can see:

```shell
              _      __  __
 __      ____| | __ _\ \/ /
 \ \ /\ / / _` |/ _` |\  / 
  \ V  V / (_| | (_| |/  \ 
   \_/\_/ \__,_|\__, /_/\_\
                |___/      
```
